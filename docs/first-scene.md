# The first scene

My first task is to get a simple scene that I can walk around in Room-scale. I don't really want game locomotion or anything else yet.
To set this up is simple enough.

1. Create a new Scene
2. Add OVRCameraRig and remove the default Unity camera.
3. Add a floor and a bunch of objects
4. Open Build Settings and click "Add Open Scenes"
5. Build & Run
